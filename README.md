Developed a modern and fully responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my technical skills, projects, and professional experience as a MERN Stack Developer. The website is built using React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for clean and responsive UI design. Implemented reusable components, smooth navigation, and optimized performance to ensure a seamless user experience across devices. The portfolio highlights multiple full-stack projects, demonstrates problem-solving abilities, and reflects strong attention to design, structure, and code quality.
